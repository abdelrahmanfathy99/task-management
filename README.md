## Task Management System
-  Develop a RESTful API for a Task Management System.
-  Implement user authentication endpoints using seeded system actors with sanctum tokens.
-  Create CRUD endpoints for tasks including filtering, dependencies, and detailed retrieval.
-  Add role-based authorization where managers handle assignments and users update statuses.
-  Ensure task completion logic prevents finishing tasks until all dependencies are completed.
